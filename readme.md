CAN BUS Test
============

This project show how to wire an arduino pro mini 328 5V with an CANBUS shield from ElecFreaks.

The ElecFreaks Shield http://www.elecfreaks.com/wiki/index.php?title=CAN-BUS_Shield
is almost the sames as Shield from SeedStudio http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/CAN-BUS_Shield
The difference is on the wiring (uses ISP pins in the place of IO pins).

The software uses the library from http://www.elecfreaks.com/store/download/product/shield/CAN-BUS_Shield/Code.zip
The library from https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield should be tested and maybe used at it looks to have more features.
